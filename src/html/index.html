    <h1>BBAP - Home</h1>

    <div class="note">
      BBAP is in a very early stage of development. So there are many features
      missing and the
      language is not stable. If you want to contribute to the project, you can find the source code at
      <a href="https://github.com/yannikHoeflich/BBAP">GitHub</a>. Any help is appreciated!
    </div>

    <p>
      This is the official documentation for the BBAP programming language.
      BBAP is designed for the SAP environment and compiles to ABAP. This means that you can use BBAP to write ABAP
      code. <br>
      BBAP is designed to be more modern and easier to use than ABAP.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If you don't work with SAP, you currently can't use BBAP!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to start using BBAP, you can find more information in the <a href="/getting-started">Getting
      Started</a>
      section.
